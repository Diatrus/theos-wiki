Theos is able to compile [Swift](https://swift.org/) files, including using them alongside files in Objective-C and other languages. Currently, Theos supports Swift on macOS, iOS, and Linux. Instructions on installing the Swift toolchains on [iOS](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-iOS) and [Linux](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-Linux) can be found on their respective installation wiki pages.

## Swift Runtime

In order to run Swift binaries built with Theos, you must install the Swift runtime on your iOS device. This can currently be found on BigBoss under the `org.swift.libswift` package (Swift 5+) or the `com.modmyi.libswift4` package (Swift 4). It is recommended that you add libswift as a dependency in your control file, with `Depends: ${LIBSWIFT}` which automatically selects the correct package based on your Swift version.

## Interoperability with Objective-C

### Swift to Objective-C
In order to use Swift classes in Objective-C, import the [auto-generated swiftmodule header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_swift_into_objective-c) by adding `#import <[instance]-Swift.h>` to your Objective-C file. Swift declarations that you wish to expose to Objective-C must be marked with the `public` or `open` modifier.

### Objective-C to Swift
Create a file named `<instance>-Bridging-Header.h` in your project directory, and import any Objective-C headers into it which you wish to expose to Swift. This header file is automatically imported into any Swift files you create.

## Variables
* `<instance>_SWIFTFLAGS` or `<file>_SWIFTFLAGS` *string*. Default: empty. Custom flags to pass to the Swift compiler for all files or a specific file (respectively).
* `<instance>_BRIDGING_HEADER` *filename*. Default: `<instance>-Bridging-Header.h`. The path to the [Objective-C bridging header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_objective-c_into_swift) to be imported into all Swift files during compilation. For more information, see [Objective-C to Swift Interoperability](#objective-c-to-swift).

## Tweaks

It is presently not possible to write tweaks in – or for – Swift, because Logos only supports Objective-C, and the ABIs of Swift and Objective-C are very different. There is, however, a large possibility that there will be ways to make Swift tweaks in the future, since Swift is now ABI stable.
