Theos is able to compile [Swift](https://swift.org/) files, including using them alongside files in Objective-C and other languages. Currently, Theos supports Swift on macOS, iOS, and Linux. Instructions on installing the Swift toolchains on [iOS](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-iOS) and [Linux](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-Linux) can be found on their respective installation wiki pages.

## Swift Runtime

In order to run Swift binaries built with Theos, you must install the Swift runtime on your iOS device. This can currently be found on BigBoss under the `libswift4` package. It is recommended that you add this package as a dependency in your control file, with `Depends: ${LIBSWIFT}`

## Interoperability with Objective-C

### Swift to Objective-C
In order to use Swift classes in Objective-C, import the [auto-generated swiftmodule header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_swift_into_objective-c) by adding `#import <[instance]-Swift.h>` to your Objective-C file. Swift declarations that you wish to expose to Objective-C must be marked with the `public` or `open` modifier.

### Objective-C to Swift
Create a file named `<instance>-Bridging-Header.h` in your project directory, and import any Objective-C headers into it which you wish to expose to Swift. This header file is automatically imported into any Swift files you create.

## Variables
* `<instance>_SWIFTFLAGS` or `<file>_SWIFTFLAGS` *string*. Default: empty. Custom flags to pass to the Swift compiler for all files or a specific file (respectively).
* `<instance>_BRIDGING_HEADER` *filename*. Default: `<instance>-Bridging-Header.h`. The path to the [Objective-C bridging header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_objective-c_into_swift) to be imported into all Swift files during compilation. For more information, see [Objective-C to Swift Interoperability](#objective-c-to-swift).

## Caveat: Libraries
It’s possible to use Swift for library instances (i.e. tweaks, dylibs, frameworks, and other bundles), and you can try it out right now (note: no Logos support yet), but there is a fundamental problem with Swift as it stands – its [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) is not stable. Each release of Swift to date has made major changes that make it impossible to use, for instance, a binary built with Swift 2.3 with the Swift 3.0 runtime libraries. It is also not possible to have multiple runtime versions loaded into a process at a time. Using a mismatched runtime version can cause dyld loading errors, meaning your code won’t run at all, or crashes due to changes to the runtime’s behavior.

Imagine this now with tweaks – your tweak targets an app built with Swift 3.0, and so the Swift 3.0 runtime is already loaded into it. You write your own tweak, also using Swift 3.0. This works, but later the app is built with a newer version of Xcode that uses Swift 3.1, and your tweak stops working or crashes. Alternatively, the app is written in Objective-C, and a tweak using Swift 3.0 is loaded into it. However, your tweak is using Swift 2.3, and loads after the prior tweak, so again your code simply doesn’t run or causes a crash.

Due to this, it won’t be possible for tweaks to be built in Swift until Swift 5. The upcoming Swift 5.0 stabilises the ABI, and likely will be able to coexist with older Swift runtimes loaded into the same process, so it will be possible to safely write tweaks in Swift 5.

Of course, as mentioned above this only applies to libraries. Non-library projects such as tools and apps are the main use case for Swift, and you can feel free to use Swift here.
