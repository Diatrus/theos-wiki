### Theos: *Unified cross-platform Makefile system.*

Theos was initially “iphone-framework”, a project created to simplify building code at the command line for iOS devices (primarily jailbroken devices). It later underwent significant changes and became Theos, a flexible [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-based build system primarily for jailbreak software development, but also with complete support for building for other supported platforms. Theos runs on OS X, iOS, Linux, and Windows (under [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)).

As of 2015, the project stalled as Dustin Howett was unable to devote time to it. It was since picked up by [the community](https://github.com/theos/theos/graphs/contributors), adding many desired features and fixing issues. The legacy version of Theos that used to be located at DHowett/theos is permanently preserved on the [legacy](https://github.com/theos/theos/tree/legacy) branch.

There is also documentation available for the original Theos at the [iPhone Dev Wiki](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos), and [theos-ref](https://github.com/theiostream/theos-ref); however be aware that not all information is updated for the changes Theos has undergone recently.
